-   {"141":{"i":{"119":null}}} Name of inverter. i = Position in the objekt "740", above. !! Do not call the entire
    "141" - object, it lasts very long or your solarlog can't handle that.

-   {"141":{"i":{"162":null}}} Device specification. i = Position in the objekt "740", above. !! Do not call the
    entire "141" - object, it lasts very long or your solarlog can't handle that.
